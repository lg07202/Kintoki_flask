          <p>In 1949,  long time before the birth of the PC, computer scientist John von Neumann said, “It would appear we have reached the limits of what is possible to achieve with computer technology.” He quickly and prudently added, “One should be careful with such statements; they tend to sound pretty silly in five years.”The acceleration of technological progress has been the central feature of this century. There has been much controversy as to whether we can create human equivalence in a machine. The technological singularity (also, simply, the singularity) is the hypothesis that the invention of artificial superintelligence (ASI) will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human.</p>

          <p>Kurzweil is also widely known as a transhumanist. Transhumanism is an international intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology (Mercer, Calvin). The word “transhumanism” appears to have been first used by Aldous Huxley’s brother, Julian Huxley, a distinguished biologist (who was also the first director‐general of UNESCO and a founder of the World Wildlife Fund). In Religion Without Revelation (1927), he wrote: The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself – not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way – but in its entirety, as humanity. We need a name for this new belief. Perhaps transhumanism will serve: man remaining man, but transcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature. </p>

          <p>A Prophetic Message
Eternity has been the part of religion for thousand of years. The way to eternity is the death itself. Some will agree that death itself gives life some kind of meaning. Religiously knowing that there is life after death, there is paradise, hell and so on gave human some kind of meaning and clearly shaped the societal structure. I am not here making a justification for religion but the uncertainty to me is “if the way our society functioning is not the right way then is transhumanism is the solution or make it better?” 
Thinking that only thing that is valuable in our life is happiness and absence of suffering is what puts transhumanism inlined with utilitarianism. The right action is which produces and maximizes the happiness. The fact that utilitarianism is solely focuses on consequences of an action but disregards the means of the action can be morally reprehensible. By doing so it also ignores the individual rights. For instance, for a utilitarian, if the net happiness of society exceeds the suffering of individuals and smaller groups, the institutionalized violence should continue. John Locke is considered the founding father of modern liberalism because he laid the epistemological foundations for all thinkers who would come after him, such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Locke uses theology, and a strong reference to God, to help him find a way out of his epistemological enigma. This can be noted in his saying, “with sense-perception showing the way, reason can lead us to knowledge of a lawmaker or of some superior power to which we are necessarily subject.”For Locke, the morality that we consider "obvious" is the result of the fact that God has endowed human beings with the ability to recognize this reality. This, of course, is in contradiction with his empirical insistence , for God contradicts the empirical premise in more than one obvious way.

The contradiction in Locke's moral and epistemological argumentation refers to Locke's hedonistic morality. Locke says that "nothing but pleasure or pain, or that which gives or conveys pleasure and pain," is important to realize morality. In Freudian terms: Man has a psychoanalytic tendency to seek joy. On this point, although we may never prove that being hedonistic is logical or rational, we have some (psychoanalytic evidence) that indicates that it is "natural" to some extent. Perhaps, if Locke knew about it, he could have worked through his epistemology to make a better starting point possible. Anyway, it was Jeremy Bentham who expanded according to the hedonistic principle. Bentham created utilitarianism, "the greatest good for the greatest number. In his works, Bentham used a language similar to Locke's, describing pain and pleasure as two "masters” or “Lords”. Many questions arose from the logical implications of this principle, including whether a scenario of "gang rape" would be acceptable or not, since it would ultimately give the greatest pleasure to the greatest number of people. Mill pointed out the hedonism that Locke initially promoted to Jeremy Bentham, a close friend of his father. In Mill's book On Utilitarianism, Mill says that human goals should be based on "joy and freedom from pain are the only things desirable as goals. For Mill, the purpose of life is to be "happy," as one can see in his proverb "utilitarian doctrine is that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable is the end." Mill tried to prove utilitarianism he says “If happiness, the end that the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself, were not acknowledged in theory and in practice to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was an end.” </p>
